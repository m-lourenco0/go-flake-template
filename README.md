# Go Development Environment with Nix Flakes

This project provides a reproducible Go development environment using Nix flakes. It includes the Go compiler and common tools like `gopls`, `golangci-lint`, and `delve` to support coding, linting, and debugging.

## What are Nix Flakes?

Nix flakes are a feature of the Nix package manager that allows for reproducible and declarative package management. They are particularly useful for setting up development environments because they ensure that all dependencies are consistent across different machines and over time.

## Included Tools

- **Go**: The Go compiler and standard tools.
- **gotools**: A collection of useful Go tools like `goimports` and `gorename`.
- **gopls**: The Go language server for editor support (e.g., VS Code, Vim).
- **golangci-lint**: A linter for Go code to enforce quality and style.
- **delve**: A debugger for Go applications.

## Setup

1. **Install Nix**: If you haven't already, install Nix by following the instructions at [nixos.org](https://nixos.org/download.html).

2. **Enable Flakes**: Ensure that flakes are enabled in your Nix configuration. Add the following line to your `nix.conf` file (typically found at `/etc/nix/nix.conf` or `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`):

   ```ini
   experimental-features = nix-command flakes
   ```

3. **Create the Flake**: 
   - Create a new directory for your Go project (e.g., `mkdir go-project && cd go-project`).
   - Add the `flake.nix` file from this repository to your project directory.
   - (Optional) Initialize a Git repository with `git init`, as flakes work best with version control.

4. **Enter the Development Shell**: Run the following command in the directory containing `flake.nix`:

   ```bash
   nix develop
   ```

   This will drop you into a shell with all the specified Go tools available.

## Usage

Once inside the development shell, you can use the Go tools as you normally would. Here are some examples:

- Check the Go version:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

- Run the linter on your Go code:

  ```bash
  golangci-lint run
  ```

- Start a debugging session with Delve:

  ```bash
  dlv debug
  ```

- Initialize a new Go module and start developing your project:

  ```bash
  go mod init your-module-name
  go build
  go test
  ```

To exit the development shell, simply type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D`.

## Optional: Automatic Shell Loading with Direnv

To automatically load the development shell when entering the project directory, you can use `direnv`. This is especially handy for seamless integration into your workflow.

1. **Install `direnv`**: Follow the instructions at [direnv.net](https://direnv.net/).

2. **Set up `.envrc`**: Add the following line to a `.envrc` file in your project directory:

   ```bash
   use flake
   ```

3. **Allow `direnv`**: Run the following command to allow `direnv` to load the environment:

   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```

Now, whenever you enter the project directory, the development shell will be automatically loaded.

## Customization

You can customize the `flake.nix` file to include additional tools or specific versions of Go. For example:

- To use a specific version of Go (e.g., Go 1.18), replace `go` with `go_1_18` in the `buildInputs` list.
- To add more tools, such as `air` for live reloading, include `air` in the `buildInputs` list (if available in Nixpkgs).

Modify the `flake.nix` file to suit your project's needs.
